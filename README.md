System identification for the DC motor to find the transfer function that best describes the system (System Identification toolbox, MATLAB).
For system Identification, real velocity was recorded against the given one (Arduino Code).
Discretizing the PID was done using the Tustin method (Simulink).
Apply the controller equation to the real system using (Arduino code).
You will need MATLAB R2023a or Latter to run this code.
